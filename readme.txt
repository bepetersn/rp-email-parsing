In preparation for the problem solving portion, we'd like for you to prepare a
code sample that will parse an archive of MSG files, and create a single output
file containing...

 - the date sent,
 - the sender,
 - and the subject

... for each of the messages processed. During the onsite interview, I will
provide a different message archive for you to process using your code.
